## What is DataCrates?

DataCrates is a program designed to back up personal documents (such as photos, videos, documents, etc.) to an archive file, known as a crate. The crate is encrypted using a user-defined password and can then be stored on a cloud service or local storage. The crates can be decrypted and the original files restored in the form of a zip archive.
